# RRFC8 - Print Publisher URL Archiving for Link Rot (HyperAtlas)
As the net has become an integral multi-media hub for humanity, there is a increased intertwining between material static media (i.e. books, magazines, scientific journals) and digital dynamic media (i.e. blog posts, social media, internet news articles)

Notably, Print based publishers (_i.e._ publishing houses, independent publishers, _et cetera_) and Internet based publisher (_i.e._ blog posters, newsletters) are increasingly creating cross links between their respective mediums. For internet based publishers, the cross linking is trivial. A publisher may reference a book title and link to an entry in Amazon, Good Reads, or another book inventory website. Note that cross linking for internet publishers to a material static media like print books posses as a "hard reference" property: static media is, well... "static", and is seldom updated. 

For print based publishers, the cross linking to the digital dynamic media create problems. The primary problem is known as ["link rot"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot):
>the phenomenon of hyperlinks tending over time to cease to point to their originally targeted file, web page, or server due to that resource being relocated to a new address or becoming permanently unavailable.

Given the barrier to internet based publishing is significantly lower than print based publishing at the moment, the generative capacity of internet publishing is significantly higher. For the purposes of argument let's suppose that internet based publishing has a 5x multiplier to the generative capacity of print media. Thus, as the knowledge mining organisms we are, as the net continues its uptake to the throughout the world, the content generated by internet based publishers will supersede that of material static media entirely at some point. What the ratio of substantive and novel information generated to reproduction and "noise" is a debate left for a different time. Regardless, the macro perspective remains the same. Over time, material static media will increase its cross linking to digital dynamic media. Thus: the problem of Link Rot becomes inevitable.

There are given solutions to handle this issue such as IPFS' [Content Based Addressing (CBA)](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/) Scheme and Archive.org's Wayback Machine snapshot feature. However, for publishers the technicality and novelty of IPFS may be burdensome, while the centralization of Archive.org may be concerning. So how could this Link Rot issue be solved?

## Approaches 
1.  Self Hosted Archive.org Plugin 
> An easy to install self-hosted snapshot plugin/program for static book websites. 
 
 It's not atypical that print books today posses a domain name and website associated. Perhaps hosted on Ghost, WordPress or a basic static HTML site. Perhaps a minimal software implementation can be created that integrates with these venues. For example, the program could ingest URLs that will be linked in the published book, take a snapshot of the content the URL targets (PDF, Markdown, or other format) and saves it to the static content folder of the website. The program could then produces a domain specific URL to the target file and these URLs could be embedded into the book.
 
2. Decentralized Archiver

In essence, duplicate the functionality of Archive.org but hosted on IPFS instead. Publishers could then run the URLs of interest through the software program and have it push out content based addresses that can be embedded into the book. There is an out standing question of the storage provider contracts that would need to be established. However, it doesn't seem unrealistic to have enough funds for say a 10 year storage contract with IPFS providers for the lifespan of the book.
